        This Agreement may be terminated with immediate effect upon the 
        occurrence of any of the following Events of Default:

        (a)     Covenants

        The failure or neglect of Licensee to observe, keep or perform any 
        of the covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement, where such 
        non-performance is not fully cured by Licensee within thirty (30) 
        days after written notice from Cryptzone; or

        (b)     Bankruptcy

        The filing of a petition for Licensee's bankruptcy, whether 
        voluntary or involuntary, or if an assignment of Licensee's assets 
        is made for the benefit of creditors, or a trustee or receiver is 
        appointed to take charge of the business of Licensee for any reason, 
        or if Licensee becomes insolvent or voluntarily or involuntarily 
        dissolved.

7.2     Obligations on Termination

        Effective with the date of expiration or other termination of this 
        Agreement, all Usage of the Licensed Products shall terminate, and 
        all rights of Licensee under this Agreement shall cease, 
        specifically including, but without limitation, the License and all 
        other rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement.

7.3     No Waiver

        Termination of the Agreement under this Section shall be in addition

             README file for MindTerm binary distribution

What is MindTerm
================
  
  MindTerm is an SSH client written in 100% java which supports both
  version 1.5 and 2.0 of the SSH protocol as well as a number of
  extensions thereof. It can be used as a standalone program or be run
  as an applet, and it works with any JRE implementing Java 1.5 or
  later. For more details see the section 'MindTerm features' below.

  MindTerm does include third party software (which is available under
  a BSD-type license). For more details see the file
  THIRD_PARTY_SW.txt

How to run MindTerm
===================

  With a modern java it is possible to launch MindTerm with:
    java -jar mindterm.jar

  With older versions of java it is necessary to specify the main
  class: java -cp mindterm.jar com.mindbright.application.MindTerm

  It is also possible to launch MindTerm as an applet. It can be run
  in a separate frame or embedded in a webpage. It is worth noting
  that the MindTerm application always runs on the users client
  machine. This means that any SSH connections will originate from
  this machine. For details on how to set things up see Applet.txt


Differences vs the commercial versions
======================================

  The main difference between the free version and the commercial ones
  is what the licenses allows. The only difference in the source code 
  is the license statements. 

  Another difference is that the commercial versions includes signed
  jar and cab-files. These are needed to get full functionality when
  running MindTerm as an applet. The following functions normally
  requires that the applet be signed:
    * Connecting to a server different from the one hosting the applet
    * Reading/writing files on the local system
    * Opening local listeners

  These limitations do not apply when MindTerm is run as a local
  application. Also nothing prevents anybody from signing the MindTerm
  applet themselves, apart form the fact that it is nontrivial to
  do :-)


Support
=======

  Support for the free version of MindTerm is only available through
  the MindTerm forum at

     http://forum.appgate.com/

  We at Cryptzone do read this forum but do not promise to answer all 
  questions.

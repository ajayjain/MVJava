                    Release notes for MindTerm 4.1

* MindTerm now trust and use the Java built-in PRNG instead of using it's
  own implementation.

* The FTPOverSFTP bridge now supports FTP APPEND.

* The file transfer dialog has been improved to better show progress when
  transferring several files.

* It is now possible use the command line option --S or option 'startsftp' to
  start only SFTP browser upon connecting.
 
* SFTP recursive copy no longer follows/copies links. 

* Fixed bug in FTPOverSFTP bridge - could not list attrs for individual files.

* Fixed applet crash when reading properties it wasn't allowed to read.

* Fixed problems with applet not closing down properly.

* Improved error message when server refuses to start interactive shell.

* Fixed problems with cursor overwriting text in terminal window.

* Fixed problems with using / as path separator for host key files.

* Add workaround for strange SFTP server which allow opening a file but
  not doing fstat on it immediately afterwards.

* Remove support for hmac-sha2-{256,512}-96 since they were removed from
  SSH protocol specs.

* Passthrough printing now supports printing to a printer in addition to
  saving to a file.

* Fixed bug with connection setup sometimes failing when specifying 
  the SSH protocol to use.


=======================================================================

                    Release notes for MindTerm 4.0

* Requires Java 1.5 or later

* Switched to use Java non-blocking io (NIO)
  This removes the need to have lots of separate threads handling
  different reads and writes and makes a big difference if you connect
  to many hosts at the same time. Note that some features (terminal
  windows, filtered channels among them) still use the old blocking
  API which requires separate threads.

* Removed AWT version of GUI
  In order to simplify the code we have removed the AWT version of the
  GUI. This has also forced us to do some more API changes. See below
  for details.

* Use the Java Cryptographic Environment (JCE) rather than its own
  cryptographic classes. This can affect the available cipher types
  and/or lengths. For example, to use ciphers like AES-256 with the
  standard Oracle JCE, the unlimited strength JCE policy files must
  be installed - contact the Java/JCE vendor for more information.

* Using the JCE also makes it possible to run MindTerm in a
  FIPS mode where only FIPS-approved algorithms are used, see
  README.FIPS.txt for details.

* Added support for elliptic curve key exchange algorithms and host
  keys. This only works if the Java Cryptographic Provider supports
  the EC algorithms (like Bouncycastle JCE).

* The code has been checked and does no longer produce any warnings
  when loaded in Eclipse.

* Embedded applet may now resize to fill the area allocated to
  it. This can be stopped by setting resizable to false


                             API CHANGES

All these changes have forced us to change a number of APIs. The most
visible of these are:

    com.mindbright.ssh2.SSH2Transport:
      SSH2Transport()
        The Socket argument to the constructors has been replaced by a
        com.mindbright.nio.NetworkConnection object. Typically this
        requires you to change code which looks like:
          Socket socket           = new Socket(server, port);
          SSH2Transport transport = new SSH2Transport(socket, prefs,
                                                      createSecureRandom());
        to:
          NetworkConnection socket = NetworkConnection.open(server, port);
          SSH2Transport transport  = new SSH2Transport(socket, prefs,
                                                       createSecureRandom());

    com.mindbright.ssh2.SSH2Channel:
      waitUntilClosed()
        This method now requires an int argument which is how long we
        should waith.

    com.mindbright.sshcommon/SSHConsoleClient:
      getProxyConnection()
        This method now returns a NetworkConnection instead of a Socket

    com.mindbright.ssh.SSHClientUser:
      getProxyConnection()
        This method should now return a NetworkConnection
      getConnectTimeout()
      getHelloTimeout()
      getKexTimeout()
        These are new methods which have to be implemented by any
        class implementing this interface.

    com.mindbright.terminal.TerminalWin:
      Constructors no longer take a Frame, instead they take a JFrame
      or a container.

    com.mindbright.terminal.TerminalMenuHandlerFull
      getInstance()
        This method has been removed, instead just create a new
        instance.
      addBasicMenus()
        This method now takes a TerminalWin and a JMenuBar as arguments
      
There are also a number of classes which have new methods which deals
with non-blocking io. The most visible of these new methods are:

    com.mindbright.ssh2.SSH2Transport:
        void setSocketOptions(String desc, NetworkConnection conn);

    com.mindbright.ssh2.SSh2ConsoleRemote:
        boolean command(String command, NonBlockingInput stdin,
                        NonBlockingOutput stdout, NonBlockingOutput stderr);
        boolean command(String command, NonBlockingInput stdin,
                        NonBlockingOutput stdout, NonBlockingOutput stderr,
                        boolean pty);
        boolean command(String command, NonBlockingInput stdin,
                        NonBlockingOutput stdout, NonBlockingOutput stderr,
                        boolean pty, String termType, int rows, int cols);
        boolean shell(NonBlockingInput stdin, NonBlockingOutput stdout,
                      NonBlockingOutput stderr);
        boolean shell(NonBlockingInput stdin, NonBlockingOutput stdout,
                      NonBlockingOutput stderr, boolean pty,
                      String termType, int rows, int cols);
        void changeStdOut(NonBlockingOutput out);
        NonBlockingOutput getNBStdIn();
        NonBlockingInput getNBStdOut();

    com.mindbright.ssh2.SSH2SessionChannel:
        void changeStdOut(NonBlockingOutput out);

    com.mindbright.sshcommon/SSHConsoleRemote:
        void changeStdOut(NonBlockingOutput out);
        NonBlockingOutput getNBStdIn();
        NonBlockingInput getNBStdOut();

    com.mindbright.sshcommon/SSHConsoleClient:
        void changeStdOut(NonBlockingOutput out);
        NonBlockingOutput getNBStdIn();
        NonBlockingInput getNBStdOut();

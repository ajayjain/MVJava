insert-mode     Toggles insert mode
key-mappings    A list of key-mappings. The format of each key mapping is

                  {[<mod>]+<virtkey>=<charsequence>} 

                where <mod> is one of
                 
                 alt
                 altgraph

                and <virtkey> is the virtual key, for example
 
                 a 
                 f2 
                 comma

                <charsequence> is the characters that should be
                output when the mapped key is pressed, for example
                if we want to map ctrl+f2 to foo, the key mapping is

                   ctrl+f2=foo

                Characters can be written as unicode characters by
                writing them as \uXXXX in files. When entering applet
                parameters on a webpage use the normal HTML escape
                sequenced (like &#27; for ESC) instead.

                Key mappings are separated with ',' for example

                  ctrl+f2=foo,shift+f2=bar

                att6386, sun, aixterm, vt220, vt100, ansi, vt52,
                xterm-color, linux-lat, at386, vt320, vt102 and tn6530-8)
virtual-kbd     Show an on-screen virtual keyboard. This property
                holds a list of keys to show. The list entries are
                separated by comma. By default the list element
                defines both the label and what is generated by
                pressing the key. What is generated can be customized
                by adding a \= and the string to generate to the list
                item. For example, the following value:

                 virtual-kbd=Esc\=\u001b,A,F1\=f1

                will show a virtual keyboard with three keys labeled
                "Esc", "A" and "F1". "Esc" will generate the escape
                character, "A" will generate a "A" and "F1" will
                generate "f1". Note that the escape character should
                be written as '&#27;' instead when it is written as an
                applet parameter on a webpage.

visible-cursor  Toggles if cursor is visible or not
visual-bell     Toggles if audible or visual bell will be used
